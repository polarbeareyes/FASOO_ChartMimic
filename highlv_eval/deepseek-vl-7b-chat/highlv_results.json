It only shows markers on the third subplot and omits them entirely on the top two.  \n\n- Layout (8/10):  \n  The overall 3×1 vertical stack of subplots is preserved, and the titles appear in the correct order. Spacing is similar. The AI version does add extra x‐axis labels on the middle plot (where the reference shared the bottom x axis only), but the basic row/column arrangement matches.  \n\n- Text Content (14/20):  \n  All three subplot titles are correct. The overall y‐axes are labeled “Value” on each subplot, matching the reference. The bottom x‐axis is correctly labeled “Time,” though the AI version repeats “Time” on the second subplot as well (not in the reference). The legend texts for “Growth” and “Decay” match, but the third legend is mislabeled “Oscillated” instead of “Oscillation.”  \n\n- Data (0/20):  \n  The AI‐generated data are sinusoidal waves (pure sine) rather than the exponential growth/decay curves and damped oscillation shown in the reference. None of the original data trends or specific values are reproduced.  \n\n- Style (5/20):  \n  The color choices (green, red, blue) and line versus dashed‐line distinctions roughly follow the reference, but marker shapes and presence do not: the reference uses circle markers for growth, “×” for decay, square markers for oscillation; the AI version omits the first two markers entirely and uses triangular markers on the third. Grid lines are present but use the default light grid style rather than the thicker gray dashed horizontals and finer verticals of the reference.  \n\n- Clarity (7/10):  \n  The plots are legible and free from element overlap within each subplot. However, the addition of an extra “Time” label in the middle subplot may cause minor confusion, and the different x‐axis labeling deviates from the reference’s shared‐axis clarity.  \n\nScore: 39/100",

The two plots appear side by side, but they bleed slightly into one another (especially at the shared x‐axis) and the subplot titles are not individually placed above each axes.  \n\n- Text Content (5/20):  \n  • The subplot titles are merged into a single long string (“Histogram of Stock Returns Investment Clusters”) instead of two separate titles.  \n  • The histogram’s y-axis label (“Frequency”) is present, but it has shifted to cover both plots, and there is no distinct y-axis label for the scatter plot in the reference.  \n  • The legend for “Gains” and “Losses” is entirely missing from the histogram.  \n  • The legend labels for the scatter are present but are reversed in color assignment.  \n\n- Data (6/20):  \n  • The reference used 50 bins and showed overlapping distributions centered around zero (one symmetric, one skewed). The AI version appears to use very few bins (≈10), producing coarse bar heights that do not match the reference frequency distribution.  \n  • The scatter clusters in the reference are sharply separated (yellow points ~y∈[0.5,2.5], blue points ~y∈[−2.5,−0.5]). In the AI plot, both clusters overlap heavily around y≈0.3–0.6, failing to reproduce the original data patterns.  \n\n- Style (5/20):  \n  • The reference used semi‐transparent bars (alpha=0.6) so that the two histograms interpenetrate; the AI bars are opaque and side-by-side, blocking one another.  \n  • The color mapping is inconsistent: in the reference “Tech Stocks” are gold and “Energy Stocks” are cyan, but the AI swaps these.  \n  • The reference includes a light grid in both subplots; the AI plot has no grid lines.  \n  • Marker size, edge color, and line style differ significantly from the original.  \n\n- Clarity (7/10):  \n  The AI plot is legible in that you can read axes, see points, and interpret two chart types.

The layout is replicated perfectly.\n\n- Text Content (8/20):  \n  The main title and axis labels (“Scatter Plot of WRMSE vs BPP”, “Bit per pixel (BPP)”, “WRMSE”) are correct.

The number of subplots, their organization, and overall figure orientation are the same.  \n\n- Text Content (8/20):  \n  The y-axis label “Execution Accuracy” appears correctly on both. However, the x-tick labels in the reference are “SQL-Only”, “PoT”, “IC-LP”, “DAIL”, “IC-LP+PoT” (rotated ~45°), whereas the AI plot uses “SQL‐Only”, “pOT”, “IC-LP”, “DAL”, “IC-1p-ROI” (straight). These deviate in spelling and formatting (case and character arrangement), and the AI version did not rotate the labels. No other annotations or titles were present in the reference, so beyond the x-labels the text is complete.  \n\n- Data (5/20):  \n  The shapes of the boxes and whiskers in the AI plot do not align with the reference distribution ranges. The AI plot shows outliers up to ~0.97 and whiskers and medians that differ from those in the ground truth (e.g. the reference’s PoT box spans roughly 0.78–0.92, while the AI’s spans a different range).

The palette, line styles, and overall look do not match the original.  \n\n- Clarity (8/10):  \n  The AI plot is generally clear—outliers are visible, boxes are well‐separated, and nothing overlaps illegibly.

While the magnitude trend is similar, the mapping to the correct model is incorrect. Subscore: 8/20\n\n- Style: The reference uses a continuous viridis colormap on each bar, black edges, and clean styling.

    "comment": "Here is my detailed comparison of the reference and AI-generated figures:\n\nComments:\n\n- Chart Types:  \n  Both sets use histograms of two classes (“positive” and “negative”), so the AI did capture the basic chart type. However, the reference overplots two semi-transparent histograms on the same axis, whereas the AI version draws the “negative” bars mirrored below zero and the “positive” bars only above, with no transparency. That is a significant departure in presentation, even though it’s still technically histograms.  \n  Subscore: 15/20\n\n- Layout:  \n  Both figures arrange four subplots in a 2×2 grid with consistent labeling (a)–(d). The AI version preserves subplot positions and overall subplot spacing. The only minor quibble is that in the bottom-right panel, the legend intrudes more on the plotting area than in the reference, but overall the grid structure is faithfully reproduced.  \n  Subscore: 9/10\n\n- Text Content:  \n  • X- and Y-axis labels (“Euclidean Distance”, “Density”) are present.  \n  • Subplot titles (a)–(d) appear in the correct locations.  \n  • However, the AI legend labels read “VI positive”/“VI negative” instead of “V-I positive”/“V-I negative” (missing the hyphen), and in panel (d) it even spells “DOLTA” instead of “DOTLA.” Also the reference uses “+” in “MIRL + OCLR…,” whereas the AI uses “w/ OCLR….”  \n  These small text mismatches cost points.  \n  Subscore: 14/20\n\n- Data:  \n  In the reference, each subplot’s two distributions have distinct means, variances, and cover roughly 0.2–2.5 on the x-axis, with peak densities up to ~1.4. In the AI version:  \n    • All four panels look almost identical (whereas the ground truth shows four different pairs of distributions).  \n    • The x-axis range is truncated (~–0.3 to ~1.4 instead of up to ~2.5).  \n    • Density never exceeds 1.0.  \n  The AI‐generated histograms do not reproduce the separate data shapes or ranges at all.  \n  Subscore: 2/20\n\n- Style:  \n  The reference uses semi-transparent fills, 20 bins, light orange/blue colors, black edges, no grids, and a framed legend. The AI version uses solid bright orange and solid blue, mirrored negative bars, no transparency, fewer bins, and no grid lines. The overall “look and feel” diverges markedly.  \n  Subscore: 4/20\n\n- Clarity:  \n  The reference is very clear: overlapping semi-transparent bars are easy to read. The AI’s mirrored-below-zero approach is visually confusing, and with no transparency the two classes cannot be directly compared on the same baseline. Despite being legible, it is less clear than the original.  \n  Subscore: 6/10\n\nScore: 50/100",

The AI plot instead has a title “Out-group bias vs Collectivism”, axis labels, and a three‐item legend for languages, but no numeric annotations. It captures the axis labels and includes a legend (though with different wording), but omits the per‐arrow values and the exact legend phrasing. Subscore: 6/20\n\n- Data: The reference shows three data points (one per language) with bias values around –2.44, –3.22, –4.00. The AI plot actually draws a ten‐point line (only matching the German series) and fails to plot the English and French series at the correct x–positions. Subscore: 4/20\n\n- Style: The reference uses red arrows with black end markers on a lightly dashed vertical grid, and minimalist black heavy borders around each panel.

The AI version splits into two full subplots but still only uses line charts. It omits the inset‐in‐main style and reduces the number of distinct line groups from four to two, so it fails to preserve the original chart types and their arrangement.\n\n- Layout (0/10):  \n  The original is a single axes with a small inset in the lower right; the AI output instead creates two separate stacked axes separated by a heavy line. This does not match the 1×1+inset arrangement at all.\n\n- Text Content (8/20):  \n  The AI plot does carry over the axis labels “Width of Layer” and “Empirical Lipschitz Constant,” but it drops half of the legend entries (only “Cos, n0 = 200” and “ReLU, n0 = 200” appear, missing the n0 = 400 curves). It also introduces non–matching tick formatting rather than the original $2^6\\ldots2^{11}$ notation.\n\n- Data (2/20):  \n  The AI figure plots only two data series (n0=200) rather than the four in the reference, and the numerical values are not consistent with the ground truth trends (e.g. the cosine curves are absent, and the ReLU values are wildly off scale).\n\n- Style (2/20):  \n  Marker shapes, line styles, colors, and legend styling differ substantially. The original used solid green and blue lines with circle / “×” markers and a lightly tinted legend box; the AI plot uses square/diamond markers, different color shades, and no matching legend box styling or grid.\n\n- Clarity (2/10):  \n  The split axes and heavy separator line create confusion about what is main content vs. inset; tick labels overlap and the overall figure is more cluttered and less immediately interpretable than the clean original.\n\nScore: 19/100",

The overall figure layout (one panel, horizontal categories) matches the reference.\n\n- Text Content (12/20): The x-axis label “Algorithms” and y-axis label “Time Cost (Seconds)” are correctly reproduced. However, the original has no legend and no extra category label, whereas the AI version adds a confusing legend (with duplicate entries) and an unintended middle “Algorithms” category on the x-axis.\n\n- Data (6/20): The approximate ranges of data points for SEAC and CTCO look roughly similar, but the AI plot introduces a spurious third category, misplaces many points with error bars, and does not clearly convey the grouped sample structure. The trend (SEAC slightly lower median than CTCO) is only loosely preserved.\n\n- Style (6/20): The AI plot uses the correct green and orange colors for SEAC and CTCO, but marker shapes, sizes, line styles, and transparency differ notably. There is no half-violin styling, the boxplot styling is harsher, and the added error bars and legend styling do not match the clean look of the reference.\n\n- Clarity (2/10): The figure is very cluttered due to error bars on every point, overlapping markers, and a crowded legend.

It also mislabels colors in the legend relative to the bar segments. Key text elements from the reference are missing or incorrect.\n\n- Data (1/20):  \n  The AI bars bear no resemblance to the reference percentages (e.g. “greeting” in the reference is 8% vs. 16%; in the AI plot it is ~85/2!). The number of data groups is correct (seven categories), but all numerical values are wrong.\n\n- Style (1/20):  \n  The original uses pastel color palettes, a bold centerline, light gridlines, and specific bar edge styling. The AI plot uses bright orange bars with a small purple overlay, default axes spines, no centerline, and no matching color scheme. There is virtually no stylistic consistency.\n\n- Clarity (5/10):  \n  The AI bars themselves are drawn cleanly and non-overlapping, so you can read rough segment lengths, but because the design is wrong and there are no data labels, the chart is confusing and does not clearly communicate the intended comparison.\n\nScore: 11/100",

The AI uses a generic title (“Right Graph”) rather than labeling each subplot appropriately, and its legend entries (“Highlight 1”/“Highlight 2”) bear no relation to “AMI WER” or “Threshold.”  \n\n- Data (0/20):  \n  The reference right subplot plots varying WER values at microphones 2–8 and connects them with a dashed line. The AI plot instead shows constant values (0.9 and 0.8) across microphones 1–9. The data trends and ranges do not match at all.\n\n- Style (0/20):  \n  The reference plot uses green squares connected by a dashed line, red circular markers for highlights, grey grids, and a bold red threshold line. The AI version uses only green and red circular scatter markers, no gridlines, no dashed lines, and none of the stylistic conventions of the original.\n\n- Clarity (8/10):  \n  The scatter points in the AI figure are clearly visible and non-overlapping, so in isolation the plot is legible. However, clarity alone cannot compensate for the missing elements elsewhere.\n\nScore: 11/100",

The AI plot only draws a single bar series (orange), overlaid with scatter/error markers for both categories, and omits the second set of bars and the twin axis. It thus fails to reproduce the exact chart types. Subscore: 10/20\n\n- Layout: Both the reference and AI plots are a single figure with one subplot and four x-categories laid out in a single row. The overall subplot arrangement matches. Subscore: 10/10\n\n- Text Content: The AI version includes the main title and a legend, but it uses a generic y-axis label (“Recall Rate”) instead of two separate y-axis labels (“Truthful Recall” on the left, “Misleading Recall” on the right). It omits the in-bar percentage annotations and does not label the right y-axis. Subscore: 5/20\n\n- Data: The AI plot’s bar heights and marker positions do not correspond to the original values for truthful vs. misleading recall (e.g., the orange bars appear at ~57 for iPhone, whereas true misleading recall was ~30). The two series have effectively been swapped and misplotted. Subscore: 5/20\n\n- Style: The original uses specific teal/orange bar fills, dashed horizontal gridlines, clean error bars, and uncluttered legends. The AI plot switches to blue/orange markers, no gridlines, a single orange bar series, and a massively repeated legend block. The marker shapes, colors, and grid style differ significantly. Subscore: 3/20\n\n- Clarity: The AI chart is confusing: legend entries are repeated multiple times and overlap the data, the hybrid bar+scatter layout is non-standard, and no gridlines make precise reading harder.

It does not reproduce the same data, the same number of rows/columns, or the discrete integer patterns.  \n\n- Style (3/20):  \n  The original uses two distinct sequential colormaps (an orange palette for LLaMA; a blue palette for GPT), gridlines, black annotation text, and a clean white frame around each subplot. The AI uses the default “coolwarm” scheme for every quadrant, no gridlines, overlapping labels, and large default font sizes. There is no differentiation in color styling or annotation formatting.  \n\n- Clarity (2/10):  \n  The excessive duplication of subplots, rotated and overlapping tick labels, and four redundant colorbars make the AI plot cluttered and confusing. Important labels overlap with data, reducing legibility.  \n\nScore: 25/100",

Thus two of the three area‐fills are missing.\n\n- Layout (9/10):  \n  The AI plot faithfully reproduces the two‐row subplot layout. Spacing is similar and the x-axes line up vertically.

The overall aesthetic detail is lost.\n\n- Clarity (8/10):  \n  The AI chart is uncluttered and there is no overlap of text or curves that impairs legibility.

The annotation color is correct, but the hallmark quiver style is missing.\n\n- Clarity (10/10):  \n  The AI plot is clean, text is legible, gridlines do not overlap confusingly, and there are no visual artifacts. It is clear to read.\n\nScore: 45/100",

    "comment": "Comments:\n\n- Chart Types (5/20): The original chart shows three data series—solar, wind, and hydropower—each as a scatter plot overlaid with a dashed line. The AI-generated chart only includes a single dashed line with scatter points (presumably wind), omitting both solar and hydropower entirely.\n\n- Layout (10/10): Both images use a single plot (one row, one column). The AI-generated layout matches the reference layout in terms of a single-axis figure.\n\n- Text Content (5/20): The AI-generated plot retains the main title and the x-axis label (“Installed Capacity (GW)”), but it omits the y-axis label (“Energy Output (TWh)”) and has no legend explaining which series is shown. There are no annotations.\n\n- Data (3/20): The AI plot only shows one dataset (200→250→300 GW against 180→190→200 TWh), whereas the reference contains three distinct datasets. Even for the included series, only three points are plotted—whereas the original had three points but in proportion to its own dataset, the AI has dropped two-thirds of the content.\n\n- Style (5/20): The AI chart uses a red dashed line and semi-transparent red markers similar to the wind series, but it fails to apply the distinct colors, marker styles, and legend styling for solar (sky blue) and hydropower (grey). There is no grid, and marker edge colors don’t match the crisp black edges of the reference.\n\n- Clarity (8/10): The AI-generated chart is free of overlapping elements and is visually clear, but the missing series and labels impede interpretability.\n\nScore: 36/100",

    "comment": "Comments:\n\n- Chart Types (18/20):  \n  The AI‐generated plot does include the two essential chart types from the reference—a bar chart with positive/negative coloring and a dashed connector line—so it broadly matches chart types. However, the connector line in the original uses circular markers at each cumulative point, whereas the AI plot omits markers (or uses inconsistent styling), so it loses a small aspect of the original’s chart type detail.\n\n- Layout (10/10):  \n  Both the reference and AI plots are single, full‐width subplots with the same title position. The overall layout (one axes, title centered above) is faithfully reproduced.\n\n- Text Content (4/20):  \n  The AI chart retains only the main title (“Waterfall Chart”) and a generic axis label (“Value”) on the vertical axis. It omits:  \n    • The category labels along the horizontal axis (“Start”, “Revenue”, “COGS”, etc.)  \n    • The per‐bar annotations of actual values  \n    • The dollar‐sign formatting on the tick labels  \n    • Any legend or explanatory annotation  \n  As a result, most of the reference’s textual information is missing.\n\n- Data (0/20):  \n  The AI plot’s bar heights bear little resemblance to the reference data sequence. It shows values like 350, 1200, 50, 200, 75, etc., none of which line up with the original’s incremental waterfall values [350, –150, –50, –120, 200, –100, 75, –135, 50, 25, –300]. The number of bars is also incorrect.\n\n- Style (3/20):  \n  While the AI bars are colored green for some positives and red for negatives, the exact mapping is inconsistent (e.g. it shows 1200 as positive green when the original 1200 was never a standalone jump), and it lacks the black edge lines around bars. The grid lines, subtle gray tick‐grid lines, and the dollar‐styled ticks from the original are entirely absent. The connector line is drawn in black and dashed, but without matching marker style or line width.\n\n- Clarity (4/10):  \n  The AI version is reasonably uncluttered, but with incorrect scaling, missing category labels, and overlapping tick labels on the horizontal axis, it’s confusing to interpret. The dashed connector line often floats disconnected from the bars. Overall it is legible but far less clear than the reference.\n\nScore: 39/100",

    "comment": "Comments:\n\n- Chart Types (0/20):  \n  The reference is a single stacked area chart with three filled regions. The AI version draws (many) overlapping line plots (and vertical “spikes”), not area fills or a true stack. None of the area‐stack functionality is reproduced.\n\n- Layout (10/10):  \n  Both images are a single subplot in a single row/column. The overall canvas size and aspect are roughly comparable, so layout is matched.\n\n- Text Content (20/20):  \n  The reference plot has no title, no axis labels (aside from default ticks), and no annotations. The AI plot likewise omits title and labels, so it faithfully matches the (minimal) text content.\n\n- Data (0/20):  \n  The original shows smooth, low‐frequency stacked curves that rise and fall gradually. The AI version shows high‐frequency oscillations and vertical spikes that bear no relation to the original data trends or stacking—data are entirely mismatched.\n\n- Style (2/20):  \n  While the AI plot uses blue, orange, and green colors that echo the reference’s palette, it does not replicate fills, line widths, transparency, or the stacked layering style. The plot also lacks grid styling and any of the visual hallmarks of the original.\n\n- Clarity (1/10):  \n  The AI-generated plot is extremely cluttered by hundreds of overlapping blue spikes, making it difficult to discern the orange and green traces. It is far less clear than the smooth, easy‐to‐read original.\n\nScore: 33/100",

    "comment": "---\n\nComments:\n\n- Chart Types (2/20):  \n  The reference uses smooth kernel‐density estimates (KDEs) for each age group plus a vertical dashed line. The AI version replaces the KDEs with overlapping histograms and flips the average line into a horizontal baseline. It thus fails to match the continuous‐curve chart type.\n\n- Layout (10/10):  \n  Both plots consist of a single main axes, with the title up top, legend in the upper left, and X–Y axes in the same positions. The overall subplot arrangement is identical.\n\n- Text Content (18/20):  \n  The AI plot carries over the main title (“Weekly Exercise Hours Distribution by Age Group”), X– and Y–axis labels, and the four legend entries (“Age 18-25,” “Age 26-40,” “Age 41-60,” “Average Exercise Hours”). Tick label styling is immaterial per instructions. The only minor quibble is the Y-axis scale labeling (counts vs. density), but the labels themselves are present.\n\n- Data (4/20):  \n  Though there are three groups, their underlying distributions are shifted dramatically upward in the AI version (ages appear to cluster around 10–12 hrs rather than around 5–7 hrs). The number of bins and density/count scaling are also inconsistent with the reference. Trends and central tendencies do not resemble the ground truth.\n\n- Style (2/20):  \n  Colors and transparencies differ: the reference uses red, purple, and brown semi-transparent fills with a dark green vertical line; the AI uses red, green, and blue histograms with a dashed green horizontal line. The grid styling (dashed grey gridlines) is absent. Line styles, marker types, and shading do not match.\n\n- Clarity (6/10):  \n  The histogram bars overlap heavily, making it difficult to follow individual distributions, whereas the reference’s smooth curves remain fully legible. The legend is clear, but the chart is visually cluttered.\n\nScore: 42/100\n\n---",

    "comment": "---\n\nComments:\n\n- Chart Types: The reference shows overlaid histograms (two semi-transparent bar series on a log-scaled y-axis). The AI plot instead draws a simple categorical bar chart. It fails to reproduce the histogram chart type entirely. Subscore: 0/20\n\n- Layout: Both are single-axes figures, so the overall layout (one plot, title above, legend to the right) is roughly matched. Subscore: 8/10\n\n- Text Content: The AI plot includes a title (“CIFAR100 \"Desert\" Concept”) and axis labels (“Concept Weight” and implicit “Count” on the y-axis), but uses double quotes instead of single quotes, omits the “Count” label explicitly on the y-axis (just shows tick labels), and its legend only lists “Camel” (no “Kangaroo” entry, no legend title). Subscore: 5/20\n\n- Data: The reference visualizes the full distribution via histograms over many bins on a log scale; the AI plot collapses all data points into two bars (one per class) with arbitrary heights of ~100 and ~50. The original data trends, distribution shape, binning, and log scale are completely lost. Subscore: 0/20\n\n- Style: The reference uses a Seaborn style with gridlines, specific pastel green and pink colors, semi-transparent bars, and a log-scaled axis. The AI plot uses default Matplotlib colors (grey and red), no grid, no transparency, and a linear scale. Legend styling and overall look do not match. Subscore: 1/20\n\n- Clarity: Although the AI plot is clear (no overlapping elements), it is misleading relative to the intended histogram. In isolation it’s easy to read, but it misrepresents the original distribution. Subscore: 7/10\n\nScore: 21/100\n\n---",
