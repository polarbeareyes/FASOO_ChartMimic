It is not the same chart type.\n\n- Layout (3/10):  \n  Both figures use two subplots labeled “Original” and “Adjusted,” so the overall subplot count and title placement are correct. However, the shape and orientation of the data blocks are completely different (the AI’s heatmaps are 7 rows tall vs. the reference’s 1‐row bands) and the category ordering is wrong, so the layout of the data elements does not match.\n\n- Text Content (2/20):  \n  The reference x-axis lists eight emotion labels in the order angry, sad, disgust, contempt, fear, neutral, surprise, happy, with each block annotated by its exact value.

All required text from the reference is there, but there is extra text. Subscore: 15/20\n\n- Data: The reference shows xLLM rising quickly then plateauing at 0.275 after step 15, while the Single-Pass LLM stays flat at 0.1. The AI-generated lines both increase linearly (to ≈0.31 and 0.30) with no plateau, so the trend and final values do not match. The number of points is correct, but the actual data shape is wrong. Subscore: 8/20\n\n- Style: The reference uses a slate-blue line with circular markers for xLLM and a thin red line for Single-Pass LLM. The AI plot uses a purple line with circle markers for xLLM and a red line with square markers for the second series. Line widths, marker shapes, and colors differ, and the legend box style is not consistent with the reference’s.

The AI-generated plot instead stacks most of its bars into a single “purple” series with a black segment on top, losing the distinct bar groups and conflating multiple metrics. Only the line plot remains as a separate element.  \n\n- Layout (10/10):  \n  Both figures use a single set of axes (one row, one column) and position the line plot on a secondary y-axis to the right.

It also includes a legend and places “Accuracy” on the right y-axis. However, it adds an extraneous title (“Comparison of Methods”), omits the specific right-axis label “Accuracy, iNaturalist 2021,” and mislabels or duplicates legend entries (e.g. “Inference log10,” “Naturalist”) instead of exactly matching the four bar‐metric names plus “Accuracy.”  \n\n- Data (1/20):  \n  The data trends and values for the grouped bars are entirely incorrect. The stacking hides the relative differences among “Train sec/img,” “Inference GFLOPS,” “Param, log10,” and “Train Memory.” The AI version also invents extra series (“Naturalist”) instead of reflecting the original numeric values. Only the accuracy line roughly follows the increasing trend but its absolute layering in the stack is meaningless.  \n\n- Style (3/20):  \n  The accuracy line and marker style (black line with circular markers) are retained, but all bar colors and group distinctions are lost. The grid style, bar widths, and palette no longer match. The legend formatting is cluttered and incorrectly colored.  \n\n- Clarity (6/10):  \n  The plot is visually busy and confusing due to the stacking of unrelated metrics into a single bar, plus an overloaded legend.

While the AI does display the “City” label in its legend, it is not the same mechanism (colorbar) and adds extra text (City1–City5) that wasn’t in the reference. Hence partial credit.\n\n- Data (0/20):  \n  The reference curves are sinusoidal‐looking temperature variations (peaks around week 6–8, then falling), whereas the AI’s lines are straight, uniformly increasing or decreasing. The shape, curvature, and even relative ordering of the series are completely off. No credit here.\n\n- Style (5/20):  \n  • Both use a seaborn-whitegrid style and dotted gridlines, which is good.  \n  • However, the color mapping is entirely different (tab-colors + dashed lines + markers vs. a smooth colormap + solid lines without markers), there’s no alpha fade, and the reference’s colorbar is absent. Significant style mismatches.\n\n- Clarity (10/10):  \n  The AI chart is clean, all points and lines are legible, and nothing overlaps in a confusing way.\n\nScore: 57/100\n\n---",

The AI output collapses everything into single, unstacked bars and even adds additional “series” that were never in the original. The fundamental chart type (stacked bars) is missing.\n\n- Layout (0/10):  \n  The original has five horizontally aligned subplots, each with its own title, x-ticks at [5,10,20], and shared y-axis context. The AI version uses one giant plot with a completely different arrangement—no subplots at all.\n\n- Text Content (1/20):  \n  The original labels each subplot “Truthful:Misleading = A:B,” labels the x-axis tick values 5, 10, 20, and includes a legend for “Truthful Recall” and “Misleading Recall.” The AI version has a single title (“Mean Values for Different Categories”), a different x-label (“Number of Participants”), a different y-label (“Mean Value”), wrong tick labels (0–13 instead of 5,10,20), and a four-entry legend that does not match the original text.\n\n- Data (0/20):  \n  The original data shows specific recall values at x = 5, 10, 20 for five ratio conditions. The AI plot shows a completely different sequence of means from ~63 up to 72 over 0–13 categories, with additional series that were never present. There is no correspondence to the ground-truth numbers or grouping.\n\n- Style (1/20):  \n  Though both use a light grid and grey dashed lines, the AI’s single pale-grey bar style, black outlines, and lack of colored stacking diverge sharply from the pastel blue/red stacked bars, annotations, and legend styling of the reference. Colors, stacking style, legend placement, and annotation positioning do not match.\n\n- Clarity (8/10):  \n  The AI plot is technically legible and free of severe overlaps, but the overcrowded annotations and extra series labels make it confusing relative to the simpler, focused original. Structurally it remains clear in isolation.\n\nScore: 12/100\n\n---",

The AI output matches the reference in having exactly one plot and similar overall framing, so it gets full marks here.\n\n- Text Content (10/20):  \n  The AI chart reproduces the main title “Pharmaceutical companies” and labels all seven segments with the company names. It also annotates percentages. However, the reference’s precise percentage values (e.g. “25.6%” for Pfizer, “21.3%” for Roche, etc.) are not matched—the AI’s percent labels are different—and there are no internal annotations or font‐size/placement choices that resemble the original treemap labels. Loss of exact percentage text costs half the points.\n\n- Data (5/20):  \n  The AI chart uses seven categories (the same number of companies), but the slice sizes and the displayed percentages are substantially different from the ground truth (e.g. Pfizer ~29.8% vs. 25.6%, Roche ~9.9% vs. 21.3%, etc.). The trends and relative proportions are incorrect.\n\n- Style (2/20):  \n  Colors in the AI-generated donut do not match the reference palette, marker/edge styling and fill choices are entirely different, and there is no attempt to emulate the treemap style (no rectangular tiling, no consistent color mapping). The legend/text placement differs markedly as well.\n\n- Clarity (10/10):  \n  The donut chart is crisp and readable, with no overlapping labels or clutter. Despite being the wrong chart type, it is visually clear and free of occlusion.\n\nScore: 37/100\n\n---",

The AI version instead draws a separate single bar for each model with no stacking or ties. Major mismatch in chart type. Subscore: 0/20\n\n- Layout: Both plots use one subplot with horizontal bars, and both list five models on the y‐axis. The AI version places its legend on the right instead of above, but otherwise the one‐panel layout matches. Subscore: 8/10\n\n- Text Content: The AI plot does include the model names along the y‐axis and labels the x‐axis “Wins,” but it introduces an unnecessary title “LIMA,” omits the numeric annotations inside each bar, and replaces the three‐item legend with a five‐item legend (“LIMA-1kl wins,” “Vicuna-1kl wins,” etc.). It fails to carry over the original labels for Tie and AG-1k wins. Subscore: 4/20\n\n- Data: The reference bars are three‐segment totals (e.g. LIMA = 68/24/8), whereas the AI bars display only one value per model, and even those values do not clearly match any of the original segment totals. The data grouping and trends are completely lost. Subscore: 2/20\n\n- Style: The original uses specific colors (blue, light purple, grey), in‐bar white labeling, and a top‐center legend. The AI uses five disparate colors, no in‐bar labels, different font sizes, and a large legend box that encroaches on the plotting area. Stylistic details are not preserved. Subscore: 2/20\n\n- Clarity: The AI’s five‐item legend overlaps part of the plot, the title placement is confusing, and viewers cannot tell which segments correspond to ties or AG-1k wins (since there is only one bar per model). Overall clarity is poor. Subscore: 3/10\n\nScore: 19/100",

The variety of markers and line styles, and the six‐plot structure, are completely missing.\n\n- Layout (0/10):  \n  The ground‐truth uses a 3‐row × 2‐column layout.

However, it omits the repeated titles for the second and third rows, fails to differentiate legend entries beyond batch‐size text, and does not include the full set of annotation details present in each reference subplot.\n\n- Data (0/20):  \n  The data curves in the AI plot bear no resemblance to the reference trends. In the ground truth, error rates decrease with increasing learning rate (from ~0.18 down to ~0.07), and accuracy curves stay in the 0.80–0.87 range with a clear peak at dropout = 0.1. The AI output instead shows a roughly linear increase in “error” up to 0.30, and an “accuracy” hovering near 1.80, both completely unaligned with the reference values, directions, and scales.\n\n- Style (3/20):  \n  While the AI version uses markers and lines, it diverges substantially in color choices, marker shapes, absence of grids, line styles, legend framing, and overall styling. None of the dashed gridlines, subtle color palettes, or distinct marker‐line combinations of the reference are faithfully reproduced.\n\n- Clarity (8/10):  \n  The AI‐generated plots are clean and free of overlapping elements; the figures are legible. Nonetheless, clarity alone cannot compensate for the numerous mismatches above.\n\nScore: 17/100",

The AI version’s bars span 0–1 on the y-axis (appearing normalized or wrong), all bins look identical in height, and the thin black line has no counterpart in the ground truth.  The underlying distributions are completely misrepresented.  \n\n- Style (5/20):  \n  The AI agent roughly matches the color palette (orange for Known, blue for Unknown) and applies some transparency, but the histogram styling (stacking vs. overlaid, bin edges, alpha levels, connector lines) does not match.  Gridlines are present but differ in thickness and z‐order.  \n\n- Clarity (3/10):  \n  The single axes is clean but misleading (bars cover the full plot height), the extraneous black line adds confusion, and without the zoom inset it fails to clarify the low-probability region.

Subscore: 9/10\n\n- Text Content: The AI version reproduces the main titles and the X-, Y-, and Z-axis labels. It does introduce an extra “Z-axis” label on the colorbar, which was not in the original. All required text is present, with one unintended addition. Subscore: 15/20\n\n- Data: The original shows smooth, high-resolution surfaces for two distinct wave patterns (sin × cos and shifted sin × cos). The AI output uses a coarse, blocky mesh (far fewer sample points) and appears to plot the same pattern twice rather than the shifted second pattern, so the data trends and distinct second wave are not faithfully reproduced. Subscore: 5/20\n\n- Style: The AI employs the same “coolwarm” colormap and retains a grid, but the shading is discrete (flat faces with black edges) instead of the smooth interpolation in the reference. The extra colorbar also alters the styling. Subscore: 10/20\n\n- Clarity: The plots are legible and free from overlapping text or markers, though the colorbar compresses the first subplot somewhat.

It fails to reproduce the horizontal orientation, the mirroring, and the separate distributions for the three groups.\n\n- Layout (10/10):  \n  Both figures use a single overall plotting area (one subplot). So technically the number of subplots and overall layout match, even though the internal arrangement of the group distributions is very different.\n\n- Text Content (12/20):  \n  The AI-generated plot correctly reproduces the main title (“Comparative Distribution of Three Different Groups”) and both axis labels (“Number of Observations” and “Value Range”). However, it omits any legend or explicit group labels (e.g. “Control Group,” “Treatment Group 1,” “Treatment Group 2”) and does not annotate the three distinct distributions.\n\n- Data (5/20):  \n  The AI plot displays three overlaid histograms binned on the same value axis rather than separate mirrored histograms for each group. The shape and spread of each distribution bear little resemblance to the ground truth, and the number of bins and alignment of values are not preserved.\n\n- Style (3/20):  \n  Colors are vaguely reminiscent of green, red, and orange, but the exact hues, the mirrored bar styling, gridlines, and the clean separation between distributions are missing. No legend is provided, and the transparency/alpha styling differs substantially.\n\n- Clarity (2/10):  \n  Heavy overlap of all three histograms on a single set of vertical bars makes it difficult to distinguish the individual group distributions. The plot lacks the clear side-by-side presentation of the original.\n\nScore: 34/100\n\n---",

The AI plot shows only four “x” marks at (70,30), (75,35), (80,40), (85,45), which does not match the original data in number, positions, or trend.\n\n- Style (1/20):  \n  The reference uses distinct colors (deepskyblue, magenta, limegreen), semi-transparent colored markers with black edges, dashed lines, and a continuous colormap for marker hues and sizes. The AI output ignores the color mapping, uses a default blue “x” marker, no dashed line style, and a cluttered legend instead of a clean colorbar.\n\n- Clarity (2/10):  \n  The AI figure is confusing: an overlong legend with repeated entries obscures the plot area, there is no clear mapping to a colorbar, and only one subplot is visible.  \n\nScore: 12/100",

However, it omits the inline annotations at each bubble (e.g. “LSTMAD-α” vs. “LSTMAD-β”), consolidates two distinct LSTMAD variants into one legend entry, and does not reproduce the original’s direct text labels on the markers. Because several text elements from the reference are missing or altered, it scores 10 out of 20.\n\n- Data (5/20):  \n  The reference chart plots six points (AR, LSTMAD-β, LSTMAD-α, AE, FITS, Donut) with inference times [10,20,30,40,50,60], average scores [0.85,0.80,0.75,0.70,0.65,0.60], and anomaly counts [50,100,150,200,250,300].

The overall arrangement of categories and axes is consistent.  \n\n- Text Content (18/20):  \n  Both versions include the same x-axis label (“Appliance Type”), y-axis label (“Energy Consumption (kWh)”), category names, and a legend with the two data‐series names (“Current Data” and “Historical Data”). The AI plot reproduces all the text elements, although the legend marker representations differ slightly from the original (no “purple” entry).  \n\n- Data (1/20):  \n  The actual distribution shapes and summary‐statistic positions in the AI plot do not match the reference. The AI’s mean stars are all over the place (e.g. Refrigerator at 0.8 and 0.1 kWh instead of ~0.4–0.5 kWh), and only the Refrigerator distribution is shown at all. The numerical trends and number of data groups per category are incorrect for four out of five appliances.  \n\n- Style (3/20):  \n  The reference uses orange and purple fills with black outlines, half-violin mirroring, and yellow stars. The AI uses blue and light blue for full violins (only one category), plain star markers for all others, changes the line styles for the “Historical Data” median marker, and lacks the distinct color scheme. The overall visual styling—colors, fills, violin orientation, legend markers—does not match.  \n\n- Clarity (6/10):  \n  The AI plot is legible in the sense that you can read all labels and see all points, but the mixed use of violin only on the first category and scatter everywhere else makes the graphic confusing. The overlapping blue and light-blue violins on “Refrigerator” are not as sharp, and the legend symbols do not correspond intuitively to the majority of the marks in the plot.  \n\nScore: 40/100",

The AI version’s grids are subtler, the line is thinner, and the camera elevation/azimuth are not the same.  \n\n- Clarity (10/10):  \n  Both images are free of overlapping labels or illegible elements and are overall clear to read.  \n\nScore: 55/100\n\n---",

    "comment": "Comments:\n\n- Chart Types (0/20): The reference plot consists of three coordinated components—a horizontal KDE overlay on top, a central scatter plot, and a vertical KDE on the right margin—whereas the AI-generated image is a single combined line/point plot with categorical x-ticks. The AI version omits the marginal density plots and does not reproduce the scatter-plus-KDE layout.\n\n- Layout (0/10): The reference uses a multi-axis layout (KDE above, main scatter in center left, KDE on the right). The AI plot is a single axes figure, failing to match the 2×2-style arrangement or marginal panels.\n\n- Text Content (4/20): The reference includes a legend titled “Species,” axis labels “Relative Cluster Size” (x) and “Average Norm of Difference Vectors” (y). The AI plot has a title, reuses the y-label, and labels the x-axis “Relative Cluster Size” but replaces numerical ticks with category names, loses the legend title, and misplaces text context. Several annotations and axis tick semantics are missing or altered.\n\n- Data (2/20): The reference shows three continuous distributions overlapping, with point clouds of ~100 samples per group. The AI version plots only three aggregated points per group connected by lines and a handful of points, not reflecting the original distributions or sample count.\n\n- Style (1/20): The original uses semi-transparent colored KDE fills (red, green, blue), small markers, no connecting lines, and white background with gridlines. The AI version uses solid blue line connecting points, inconsistent marker fill, default styling, and lacks transparency, matching colors neither exactly nor consistently.\n\n- Clarity (8/10): The AI plot is visually uncluttered and legible as its own standalone chart, but since it diverges entirely from the original’s intent, its clarity does not salvage the mismatch.\n\nScore: 15/100",

The AI plot only has a single title (“MS-COCO”) at the top plus generic axis labels; it omits the second subplot caption, the dashed threshold line, and the specific subplot labeling for Flickr30k.  \n\n- Data (0/20):  \n  The reference shows two distinct data series per bit (increasing blue bars and decreasing salmon-orange bars from bit=0 to 9, plus four baseline bars). The AI figure replaces these with three entirely different series (Precision, Recall, and F1-score) with values ~400–480. The trends, groupings, and counts do not match.  \n\n- Style (1/20):  \n  The original uses a specific color palette (forest green, golden brown, dark red, purple, salmon, sky blue, red), white bar edges, and a dashed grid line at y=600. The AI chart uses olive, coral, and teal with no edge styling, no dashed line, and a different legend placement.  \n\n- Clarity (8/10):  \n  The AI chart is visually clean (bars are distinct, text legible), but since the data and layout are wrong, the clarity on the wrong content is of limited value.  \n\nScore: 12/100\n\n---",

Only the line plot aspect is present.\n\n- Layout (10/10):  \n  Both plots are single subplots (1×1 arrangement) occupying the full figure. The overall layout (one chart, shared x-axis from 2015 to 2019, shared y-axis) matches.\n\n- Text Content (4/20):  \n  The reference has a legend with full labels “Apple Production,” “Banana Production,” etc., but no axis titles or figure title. The AI version adds a main title (“Production of Fruits”) and axis labels (“Year,” “Production”) that are not in the original, and it shortens the legend entries to “Apple,” “Banana,” etc. Key text from the reference (the exact legend wording) is not faithfully reproduced.\n\n- Data (1/20):  \n  The reference data are non-linear and specific (e.g. bananas 80–78–85–90–95, apples 50–55–53–58–60), whereas the AI plot uses perfectly linear runs (apples 50–55–60–65–70, bananas 40–45–50–55–60, etc.). The trends, values, and ordering are all incorrect relative to ground truth.\n\n- Style (2/20):  \n  Colors, marker shapes, and line styles differ substantially. The reference uses red squares, blue circles, green triangles, orange diamonds with pastel area fills and dotted grid lines; the AI version uses orange circles, blue squares, green triangles, yellow diamonds without fills, with a different grid style and no semi-transparent coloring.\n\n- Clarity (10/10):  \n  The AI plot is clean, legible, and free of overlapping elements. It is easy to read, with well-spaced markers and grid lines.\n\nScore: 32/100",

    "comment": "---\n\nComments:\n\n- Chart Types: The reference uses a grouped bar chart with three side-by-side series (RBF-INT, RBF-POL, RBF-COM) for each PDE. The AI plot collapses these into a single set of bars (only one apparent series) despite showing three legend entries. It fails to reproduce the grouped bars. Subscore: 2/20\n\n- Layout: Both the reference and the AI version use a single subplot and place the legend in the upper left. The overall layout (one axes, legend position) matches. Subscore: 10/10\n\n- Text Content: The AI plot includes the x-axis label “PDEs,” the y-axis label “log L2,” and the three legend labels. However, it introduces an unrelated title (“Diffusion, Poisson, Burgers, N-S”) that was not in the reference and omits a proper overall description. Subscore: 12/20\n\n- Data: The original bars reflect logarithmic L2 errors (ranging 1e-4 to 1e-1) for each of three RBF schemes. The AI bars show linear values around 0.3–1.1 for only one series; none of the original data values or trends are reproduced. Subscore: 0/20\n\n- Style: The AI plot drops the log scale (using a linear y-axis), loses the distinctive purple/red/orange color mapping per series, omits grid lines, and does not offset bars for clarity. It also misuses the legend (only one color is visible). Subscore: 2/20\n\n- Clarity: At least the single set of bars is clearly drawn without overlap, and labels are legible.
